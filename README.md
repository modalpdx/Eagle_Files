#CADSoft Eagle Files

Here are some random files that I've used to augment Eagle for my
projects. 


##Libraries

Please note that I'm not an expert at creating components in Eagle. I'd
much rather stand on the shoulders of giants. Still, when backed into a
corner I can whip out a part or two like an old...amateur. 

No harm should come to you if you use these parts. Use them as you want.
